# What is a routeserver?
The routeserver is a centralized server that facilitates communication between all instances. The routeserver acts solely as a relay. We will never filter, log, or monitor any data passing through the official routeserver.

# Can I use my own routeserver?
Yes, you can use your own routeserver. However, routeservers can only interact with instances that are also relaying through the same routeserver. Instances on your routeserver will not be able to communicate with instances using the official routeserver, or any other routeserver.

For the sake of maintaining a unified and interconnected network of instances, we recommend using the official routeserver.
